        <h1>Github Branches</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Github branches lets you commit changes to your files without saving it in your roots. Basically you can create a tree of brances for experimenting.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The history is still saved but it creates oppurtunity to work on two different outcomes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It is possible to branch out to experiment, then branch back into main if you like the experiment.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pull, push and merge request lets other users request the admin to merge a branch back into the main branch.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can commit changes to the main and sub branches simultaneously, then merge them back together</p>
