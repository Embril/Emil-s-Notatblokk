        <h1>Github Forks and Pull request</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Fork is basically "clone" an entire branch from one Github user to another</p>
        <br>
        <p>Very usefull if you want to experiment in a branc but not affect the original branch</p>
        <br>
        <p>if you like the experiments and you want to merge them back together, you are using the pull request</p>
        <br>
        <p>Owner of the original branch has to accept the pull request</p>
        <br>
        <p>to create a pull request press edit or the fork button on the screen in the project.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Note: if you are working in a branch, it will commit changes to main branch in fork user's account</p>
